# Master Cipher

This is a project to create a desktop application where users can encrypt and decrypt their
texts. Everyone with the specific settings can decrypt or encrypt in the same format, 
and have a conversation in the same "language".

## Why i do this?

I am a Systems Engineering student, and I have knowledge in Artificial Intelligence and some
in Data science. I'm just trying to improve my skills developing software. For this Proyect
i used some old encryption personal projects and try to use them in an application that has
a visual interface.

## How does it works?

The application without the GUI has a fairly simple operation, it instantiate a class 
named MasterCipher than use two different cipher methods to encrypt and decrypt text in a 
secure way. Those two cipher methods are own implementation of the Vigenere Cipher and the 
Rail Fence Cipher, than was developed by me some time ago, and will be optimized in soon.

To run the program, execute the main.py file on the shell.
